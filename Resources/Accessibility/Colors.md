# Accessibility with respect to color

## Why should you care?

Everybody uses the internet and each of them are different! It's unlikely that you will know every user so creating a website that some can't use is annoying to them and detrimental to your websites growth. Having more users helps expand the site's reach and increases the likelyhood of gaining more users in the future.

## Who does this affect?

The short answer is everybody! Ensuring that colors are easy to see and read is important for everyone but especially people who have color blindness or other impairments.

## Common pitfalls

Colorblindness can effect people in all areas of life, from reading color coded information to pursuing certain careers. Color coded information presented in certain color scheems, expecially when contrast is low, can be hard or impossible for some color blind people to interpret. When diferentiating informatin by color, for example in certain charts or graphs, it is important to select a color scheem that facilitates readability.
